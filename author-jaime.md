# Jaime Salcedo

I started coding in 1995 the age of 7 when I asked my parents to sign me up to QBasic training, all my classmates were 10-15 years older than me. My parents challenged me to pass the course and they would buy me a computer; a Toshiba 2200sx, my first laptop.

From that moment I knew that I wanted to be a developer, I have programmed from web pages to video games and even today I am still looking for new motivations and learning every day. 

My life is currently splitted between coding, netflix and take care of my two beautfiul daughters.
Becoming a father changed me in so many ways, I survive on less sleep than I ever thought but they make me view life from a different and creative perspective.
