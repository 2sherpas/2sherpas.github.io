I want to start a series of articles about coding, basic coding to be honest.

After many years of managing people, my coding skills are rusted but my love for coding is intact and I am determined to get back to a decent coding level.

For achieving such a thing the first thing I need is to find a “project” that will motivate me and give me different types of challenges. I wanted something that I can use and is giving me value in my day to day activities. After some thinking, I decided that the best project will be to digitalized my running log. I have hundreds of entries in a spreadsheet, yes I know… such a terrible thing, but it is a reality, I do have years of running and walking and other outdoor activities listed on a spreadsheet and then I have complicated formulas to give me graphics and comparative data and… and every day is more and more complicated to manage and maintain.

So it’s time to run away from my current crap solution to a much better and clever way of storing and playing with my activities information.

My idea for the project is to split it into several phases and achieve small incremental steps that help me end having a new Digital Running Log, the stages I will go are

* **Use python to read a Gps file information**
* **Send the Gps file information to a Data Base**
* **Improve the python script to iterate over a list of files**
* **Connect to Garmin Connect API to download my data automatically**
* **Represent the data from the Data Base in a web page**

If I can achieve those steps then I will have a system that download my activities from the web, extract the information I need, send the information to my DataBase and then show it to me on a great web page; what an awesome achievement will be.

Now is time to see how bad my coding skills are and how long it takes me to Digitalized my Running Log.

See you in the next article of this series.

Thanks,
