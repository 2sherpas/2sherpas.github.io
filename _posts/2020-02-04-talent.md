It is a common topic in the industry, it is something most companies are talking about and investing money and time; talent. Having talent within your company should get you closer to great achievements and leading industry in your area.

The question here is how you get yourself surrounded by that talent?

In my experience we all make the mistake to think that we can create it, we can create a process that will make an ordinary person a talented one, a system that if we run smooth enough will guarantee constant availability of talented people within our organization and our teams. Is this possible? My answer is NO.

Let me explain myself a bit more, talent, in my opinion, is unique to each person, we are all talented people in some way, we all have our potential and our unique set of skills that make us talented but do companies have the right set of people and processes to let those talents flourish? I don’t think so.

Companies want to recruit someone that they can be embedded in any team and suddenly be amazed by the results, someone who in isolation will make a difference, will drive us to victory… Does that person exits? I don’t think so.

The key to end having talented people in our organizations is to pay attention to each one of our team members and make sure we craft a path that will let them shine and grow in the direction they need, in the direction we will get the best of them; none of us will be able to flourish under the same conditions.

We should stop worrying about creating talent and be more concerned about helping our people be that talented person we are looking for.

Will companies be brave enough to trust the quiet one, the different one, the one that fails at the beginning but has potential…??? Who knows… in a world were everything must happen immediately it is difficult to see companies having the patient to let their people be the amazing factor.

Let’s stop thinking there is a magic wand we can use to create talent and let's become gardeners and help our people flourish with their own beauty.
