In my last post I talked about [Flask](https://2sherpas.github.io/Flask) and how easy it was to created our webpage; today I want to show you how we can create our own APIs using Flask.

I want to start by saying that we will create something really simple to demostrate how Flask works with APIs, we won't be using databases or security... just a simple and easy to test API in Python.

Enough talking :) let's move to coding

**Our starting point**

We have already created a Flask application in my previous post so we will start by using that code as the base for our API, there is no point going trough the basics again in this post.

**Our Data**

For this example we will create two endpoints, one to list mountains and one to add a new mountain to our Mountains list, the list won't be stored in a database, it will be a in memory Python dictionary but it will help us simplify the explanation and get focus in the API and not in other concepts.

Of course real APIs use databases and cool stuff but let's remember this is just a really simple introduction, not the "Flask API bible".

The first thing we will do to our existing Flask application is to create a Python Dictionary that we will use as our Mountain list. We have our dictionary inside of a list so we can have more than one mountain. 

{% highlight python linenos %}
from flask import Flask, render_template

app=Flask(__name__)

mountains =[
    {
        'name': 'Everest',
            }
    ]

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template("home.html")


app.run(port=5000)


{% endhighlight %}

Now that we have our data ready to start playing is time to create our first API endpoint; for this example we will create two endpoints, one to list all the mountains and one to add a new mountain.


**Create the endpoints**

It is really easy to create an API endpoint in Flask, they are just routes within our app.py file. Let's create the endpoint to list all of our mountains.

Wait!! before we do that we need to do something first, we need to import something new into our Flask app, APIs are base on JSON and to use JSON in Flask we need to import it, so back to our original code and add it.

{% highlight python linenos %}

from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify

{% endhighlight %}

Ok, now we can start defining our first endpoint /mountain :)
Let me explain that when you expose and endpoint in Flask you can use Post or Get method but if you don't specify it will be a Get method by default, in our case we want it to be Get so we don't need to do anything else.

Here you have the code for our example


{% highlight python linenos %}

@app.route('/mountain')
def get_mountains():
    return jsonify({'mountains':mountains})

{% endhighlight %}

This will return the Json representation of our Mountains dictionary

**How we test it?**

Now that we have our first endpoint defined we need to test it and see what happen; the best way to test APIs is to use [postman](from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify) I won't explain how to install it in this article, we will assume that you have already experience with it.

First thing we need to do is start our application by running below command in the terminal

>> python3 app.py

Now we move to postman; I like to create a new collection so I can have my things organised but that's up to you.
I have created a collection called 2Sherpas and add a new request on it with this information "localhost:5000/mountain"

![Postman]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/postman.png)

If we click "Send" then the call will reach our Flask application and our /mountain route will then return the JSON representation of our dictionary, let's try...

![Postman]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/postmanSent.png)

There it is, we have publish our first endpoint and tested it using Postman.

As you can see it was really quick and simple, we just needed three lines of code and we were ready :)

Now it's time to create our final endpoint to create new mountains.

**Add a mountain**

To create this new endpoint we need to remember that by default Flask endpoints are a Get method and in this case we will need it to be a Post method so we will need to specifi it in our route definition.

The other thing we need to do is to understand that in this case our server won't be just sending information to the network, in this case we will be recieving information that we need to proccess, in order to do that we must import something new  from Flask

So the first line of our app.py file will looks like this

{% highlight python linenos %}

from flask import Flask, render_template, jsonify, request

{% endhighlight %}

And our new endpoint will be something like this

{% highlight python linenos %}

@app.route('/mountain', methods=['POST'])
def add_mountain():
    request_data = request.get_json()
    new_mountain = {
        'name': request_data['name']
    }

    mountains.append(new_mountain)
    return jsonify(new_mountain)

{% endhighlight %}

As you can see we have specified the method for the new route and we have created a variable called request_data that will contain the information coming from the http request in json format; the rest of the code is really straight forward, create a dictionary with the information from the request and add it to our existing dictionary.

Now we can test our new endpoint, back to postman and we will create K2

![Add a new mountain]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/addMountain.png)

As you can see in previous image the new mountain has been created but to make sure we have created it we must run again our first endpoint and see if now the list contains our new mountain, let's run it

![Add a new mountain]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/2mountains.png)

**We did it!!!** we have published our first two APIs using Flask and tested them using postman.

As I said at the beginning of this article the intention was not to created two super complex and amazing endpoints but to understand how easy and quick it's to do it in Flask, I hope you have enjoyed the explanation.

See you in the next article.
