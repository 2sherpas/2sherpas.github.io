Until now we've been publishing a series of articles about coding and our experience working with development teams but it was time for us to go on a train trip an attend a conference in London, Digital XChange.

The Conference was divided into three sections from three different speakers

* Klarna
* Starling Bank
* Spotify

We were positively impressed with the way it was organized; big open space with free drinks and food and a really friendly team on the ground making sure you feel welcomed.

> **Klarna**

It was an interesting presentation that went through the hot topis of team management and software delivery.

The speaker divided the presentation into 6 different points

>>_Your strategy is your team_ - We do completely agree with this statement, as we explained before in a different article we are strong advocates of the importance of creating strong teams if you have a great vision and high ambitions but you don't have the right team you most probably will fail. 
Understanding that the team is your strategy will help you deliver better products and what it's more important it will help you enjoy the journey.

>>_Team velocity is key_ - We disagree with this point, from our experience velocity is something that doesn't matter, every team measure velocity in different ways and we have experienced how some teams play with the way the calculate velocity so they can present what managers could consider better velocity, but velocity won't take you really far. In our opinion **quality is key**, if you can't deliver quality it doesn't matter how fast you are, you won't make a difference and you won't impress anyone; focus on quality and you will succeed.

>>_Delay is cost_ - There is no much to say in this, we all know that being late is not only the cost of the team but the impact of not delivering and creating precedence for future bad expectations.

>>_Make your own warning signals_ - It is clear that every team and every product will respond to different situations and requirements so you must create and set up properly your own warning signals to be able to react to the issues that have a real impact on your delivery. We have seen many teams that use warning signals from generic documents or blogs and they end reacting to things that have no impact on their delivery and missing the critical ones.

>>_Group around the design_ - I will say that we strongly agree with this, from the very beginning of our Sherpa initiative we were focus, even obsess some times, with the idea of design first. As development teams we often forget that what we are selling is not code, is products, and people, managers, investors.... they buy products that they feel engage, interested... I can't think of a situation where an investor will put any money after looking to a perfectly created loop block in Python... Get the idea, create a design and then start producing.

>>_Ownership without territory_ - No doubts we agree with this idea and it strongly links with the idea of "your strategy is your team"; you can just deliver what your team is capable of if the team does not feel ownership of the delivery it's a weak team. It doesn't matter how good technically the team is, without ownership, they will never deliver that product that has an impact, that makes a difference. If you want to change the world you need to let the team own the product.

> **Starling Bank**

The speaker from Starling Bank was probably the one that made more impact on us, the ideas that he presented were somehow bold and different and we were engaged with the way he explained the whole concept.

>> _Get rid of Jira_ - Now that every Agile team and every organization is trying to find the best solution for the Team dashboards (Jira, Trello...) Starling Bank got rid of Jira. The idea landed in my mind like a bomb... what was he trying to achieve? and I loved the answer. In simple words by getting rid of Jira they have achieved something wonderful, now people need to pay attention in meetings and understand what the team is doing, you can't just ignore the team and then run a burndown chart or look to tickets and generate a team status report, you need to understand the team, the issues, the goals... getting rid of Jira looks like a real option. Do we want to be people-centric? then forgot the tools and pay attention to people; I know... bold statement.

>>_No analyst and no project manager_ - Apparently that's Starling Bank strategy, get really good engineers and give them the ownership of what they are doing, if you can do that then your development teams are truly independent and capable of that self-management golden ticket that we all want to win.

> **Spotify**

We all know Spotify and how they change the way that people listen to music and helps you find more music you could like by using their algorithms.

The presentation was focussed on the difference between machine learning and artificial intelligence and how they are using them to improve their products and create a better customer experience.

We found the presentation somehow a bit bland and probably more into the technical area than the product design and digital transformation speech, I must say we were not particularly engaged with the talk.

## Summary of the event

It was really nice to attend a small conference and listened to new ideas that I'm sure will help us in the future.

Here you have some photos of the day, for next time I promise we will have a photo of Jaime and myself hehe
