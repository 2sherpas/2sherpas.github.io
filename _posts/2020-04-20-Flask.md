As you know I've been learning Python for the last few weeks and I have already had fun using [Jupyter Notebook](https://2sherpas.github.io/Jupyter-Notebook) and creating simple web pages with [Django](https://2sherpas.github.io/Django).

Today I want to introduce you to Flask, a different Python web framework that is meant to be light and more flexible than Django so let's take a look.

**Let's start**

First, we need to install Flask. As in my previous posts all my code and command are from a Linux computer, remember it might differ if you are using Windows or Mac.

You can decide to install Flask in a Python virtual environment or directly into your main distribution, it's up to you. I have personally installed it in a virtual environment so I don't need to worry about messing around with my other projects.

All we need to do is to go to our terminal and run this command

>pip3 install flask

And you are ready, you don't need to do anything else. Now it's time to start creating our first basic Flask app. 

**Let's create our first Flask app**

Remember before we move forward that you will need to run all the commands and create files in the folder where you want to create your first Flask application.

Once you are in the correct directory let's start by creating a file called app.py and add this code

{% highlight python linenos %}
from flask import Flask

app=Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return "Hello 2Sherpas"

app.run(port=5000)

{% endhighlight %}

This code has created our first Flask application. We have imported Flask and create and application then we have added the root directory to our app and define a function that returns a simple text. We have specified the port too where we want our Flask server to run, in our case 5000

If we go to our terminal and in the directory where we have our code we run this command we will start our server

> python3 app.py

![Flask running]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/flaskRunning.png)

As you can see it is running in our localhost:5000 Let's take a look to it using our web browser

![Flask localhost]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/localhostFlask.png)

There it is :) our first Flask page up and running; I will say that this was even quicker than using Django. 

Obviously, a text can't be considered a page but we will get there, let's do some more steps and return a real Html page.

**Let's render**

If we want Flask to return an Html page and not just text we need to do some quick changes to our app.py code so back to our editor and let's make those changes...

First, we will need to import render_templade from flask and then change our root route to point to the folder where we will have our Html pages; by default, Flask will search for those pages into the templates folder within your project

This is how the project structure should look like

![Flask project structure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/flaskStructure.png)

And this is how your code should look like now

{% highlight python linenos %}
from flask import Flask, render_template

app=Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def home():
    return render_template("home.html")

app.run(port=5000)

{% endhighlight %}

Our home.html file will be super simple


{% highlight python linenos %}

<h1>Hello 2Sherpas</h1>
<h2>This is our first Flask page</h2>

{% endhighlight %}

Ok, so now that we have finished all of our changes we can go back to our terminal and run again

> python3 app.py

The server is up and running so we can go back to our web-browser and refresh the page or enter http://localhost:5000

![Flask html page]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/flaskHtml.png)


**Awesome!!!** we have our own Html page in Flask.

Of course, Flask is much more powerful and you can do more things, connect to databases, publish APIsâ€¦ but that is for another day.

In my opinion, using Flask is easier than Django if you want to create something simple and remain in control but once again I won't tell you what's best or what's wrong, I have just enjoyed the experience and hope you have learned something too.

See you in the next article.

Thanks for reading it.
