I had always wondered if someone can be a good manager trying to follow someone else way; to be a good manager should be the capacity to be a good leader, and to lead should be the capacity to inspire people, motivate people and help them be themselves, leading is not making people follow you, in my opinion, that’s dependency and dependency is a dangerous game.

Every time I have had the opportunity to take care of a group of people I had tried my best to be myself, to show the true me with all the defects and all the dreams that I carry along the way.

So the inevitable question for me is; who am I so I can know what type of manager I am. It is not an easy question, as one person tends to have multiple aspects of his life; as an example, I am a father, an uncle, a brother, a husband… but those things probably don’t describe me, those things end being places where I try to lead too, probably being a father and uncle and a husband are just example of places where we lead, and to lead is to let other people influence who you are and be a better you, I’ll try to be back to that concept later.

So let's go back to who am I, I think I will define myself as an endurance guy, I have always love endurance activities like hiking, climbing, mountaineering and running. I have never felt represented in other sports like football or basket, I have never enjoyed watching sports on a TV and I have never been a good indoor cat, I have always found myself looking out through the window and wondering what could I d to go outside. Maybe that’s who I am, an outdoor cat, an endurance person… so probably the answer to my initial question “What type of manager I am?” could be as easy as “a running manager”.
 
If I have found out what type of manager I am, now I will try to understand how that affects the way I manage people. It would be important to find those aspects of running that I carry to other areas of my life, in this case managing people.

## Characteristic of a long distance runner

> More mind less Legs

Running long distances is mostly a mind game, it is not about being physically strong or fit, it is about trusting yourself and not letting the current moment take away the end goal. Most people will think that running long distances is about getting your legs ready, and yes you must do that but your legs will carry you as long as your brain can remain focus on the end goal and forget about the momentary pain.

 
How do I translate that idea to team management? I can’t see a team working at full capacity if the team is just made of legs, and by legs I mean really good developers that are focus just on coding; the Team needs a strong mind that keeps them going, and that mind is not the team leader, that mind is the team spirit. I try to spend a big time thinking about how to increase the team spirit, how to make the team understand the end goal and push for it, not because someone asks for it but because the team as a unit wants it. Building a team is like creating a training plan, you must have a clear goal and then you must know the strong points and the weakness of the runner (in this case the team) to create the perfect training plan.
I have seen many managers worrying just about the developers (their legs) and not paying attention to the team spirit (the mind) and that in some cases works but don’t get confuse, you don’t have a team you have a group, it is really important for me to understand the difference between a group and a team. A group will never be as powerful as a team.
Of course, a good team needs to have good legs, not just a strong mind, but the best legs in the world won’t carry you for 26 miles if your mind is not able to go through the temporary pain and discomfort and focus on the end goal.

> Head down

If you have run longs distances you know what I mean, head down is something that we all know it will happen, we don’t know when, we don’t know for how long and we don’t know how to avoid it but if you are a long-distance runner you know how to deal with it, you just keep your head down and focus on the foot of the runner in front of you, forgot about the time, the distance, the pain… all that must go to a second level, a level where it can’t mess with your end goal; you just focus on the foot of the runner in front of you and keep moving. Why you do that? Because you trust the work you have done, the preparation and the hours you train and know that temporary pain is just a fee you pay for the end goal.
So back to the same question? How do you translate to team management? A strong team must trust each other and know that not every project and every task will go as planned, not all of them will be finished without discomfort, without temporary pain; but a strong team know that if they trust the journey, the learnings, the preparation and the capacities of the team, then no task can’t be accomplished.
A successful team is not a team that delivers on time every time, because every team will eventually fail, a successful team is a team that faces a challenge and remains strong, united and focus, a team that won’t panic when things are not as planned. A strong successful team will be able to work as a unit under the worst circumstances.
