I've been wanting to write this article for some time now so I decided that today it was the day, no more excuses no more delays; hands onto the keyboard.

We all know about Linux and how this open-source and free operating system has grown in the last years as an option for desktop users that don't want to pay a private license (Windows, OSX...) or just want to try something new and explore alternatives to the Windows and Mac big empires. I don't want to write about what it's best or why you should move to Linux or not, that's up to you and I don't want to put more fire on a fight that is already big enough.

My intention with this article is to share a personal reflection on a really simple topic; do kids need expensive computers? Do we really need to spend too much money for them to be able to do their homework, will it make any difference? My opinion is no, you don't need a new shiny computer you just need to put Linux into an old computer and you will be fine.

I've been using Linux as my main operating system for the last 20 years and I don't regret that decisions, that's why when my 7 years old son needed a computer to do the school homework I decided that it was time to apply the same rule, Linux will be the answer.

Let me present the main points about the experience

> **It's free** - You don't need to pay any money for the operating system and you have hundreds of different flavors to choose, from the super popular [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com), to the more puristic [Debian](http://www.debian,org) there is a desktop for every person. Most of the Linux distros are significantly lighter than any other OS and that will allow you to take that old laptop that you are not using out of the closet and give it a new life.

> **Kids adapts super fast** - Kids are super good with changes and they adapt fast to new things; on top of that my son experience with other operating system was really limited, just a few hours of school computer so he was not really a hard Windows user. When I put Linux on the computer he didn't even mention it, he just started to use it as a normal computer; he found the web browser and the tools he needed to do his basic homework and happily use it.

> **Coding by default** - Using scratch o any other tool to learn coding in Linux is easy and I feel that teaching my son to code using a Linux machine could be the best start for a career in IT if he decides to go on that route.

> **Any negatives?** I haven't found any negative aspect yet to it, as far as I can tell the experience is positive and we are both loving it. We might find some issues in the future I won't deny that but I'm sure we will find an answer, you can do anything in Linux.


So if you have an old laptop and you want to give it a new opportunity Linux could be the solution, free, quick and with some super nice desktops available; the most difficult part will probably b to decide which [distro](https://distrowatch.com) you want to install.

Have fun!!
