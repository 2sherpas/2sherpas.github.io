I just wrote an article about Linux for [Kids](https://2sherpas.github.io/Linux-Kids) and it is something I really support and would like to see in more schools and pulic places but there is a bigger question probably, **it is Linux an option for everyone?**

I have used Linux as my operating system at home for the last 20 years and I have never look back to Windows, I need to recognised that back then distros were not so stable and friendly and Ubuntu didn't exits.

Suse Linux was my first distro, I bought a box with the books and the operating system, Internet was not even an option to download that type of file so I went to a store and come back home with a semi-destroyed box and a happy mind; it was the starts of my Linux adventure.

Using Linux back then was a hard decision, most of the graphics and basic hardware like your modem were not supported by default and you needed to find and compile drivers for every single component, most of the time (at eats for me) trying to fix something meant losing everything and starting from scratch, I can't count the number of times I reinstall my operating system, it was almost a daily task hehe... 

**Why I decided to move to Linux?** Honestly I don't remember, probably it was the same reason it took me to do many things... curiosity. I knew that Windows worked perfectly on my PC and I had the licence that come with the computer but.... where it's the fun on it? I wanted to learn, I wanted to discover and I think it was a big element of I wanted to avoid using fake serial numbers for applications. I have always had a strong respect for other people work and I have refused to download music, movies, books... snd Linux gave me the oportunity to have all the tools I needed for free and without breaking the law.

**What about now?** Linux has improved a lot in the last years and moved from a command line pain in the ass for normal users to a super stable, friendly and amazing operating system that let me do anything without worryng too much about configurations, drivers, compatibilities... and I will say in same cases the desktop is even better than Windows (let's leave OSx out for now...)

**My current experience**

My current Linux configuration is working really well for me, I have a Dell XP laptop and Ubuntu 19.10 installed. Everything worked perfectly from day zero, the hardware is all recognised and the SSD disk means that my operating system starts as fast as I couldn't even imagine.

Let's talk about my day to day experience with my Linux laptop but first let me make something clear, I won't be comparing Windows with Linux and which one is better, I will focus only in my Linux experience, I trully believe that Microsoft has some amazing products and you pay for what you get but in my case the question remain the same, can I do the same for free?

> **Office work**

[LibreOffice](https://www.libreoffice.org/) is a great office suite that let me do anything I need, from writting documents to create presentation and keeping my running spreadsheet updated. I am clearly not an expert user and I use 1% of what the suite provides but I'm sure most of the people out there is using that 1% of other office suite like Microsoft Office or similars. I have never encountered a task that I couldn't finish using Libre Office suite and every time I search in Internet I can find thousand of pages with information that helps me.

Libre Office it's installed by default as part of the Ubuntu installation process so you don't need to worry about it.

>**Internet Browsing**

Most of us today will be technologically dead without Internet so hving an operating system that is not letting us browse the web it will be a dsaster, I can't think of any and of course Ubuntu is not an exception, you can install the most popular web-browsers in your computer without any issues.

By default you will get Firefox as part of your installation procces but you can install pretty much anything, in my case I have added Chrome to my browser list. All you need to do is visit the Google Chrome download page and select the correct one for your operating system version

![Google Chrome]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/chrome.png)

You can do the same using the Linux terminal but honestly I don't see a reason for that, I know some people love the terminal, and it is really good for when you need it but... if you can use a super easy way why to complicate it?

You can have lots of different browser like Opera using the same simple concept of downloading the package and installing it

![Opera]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/opera.png)

In my case Firefox and Chrome are all I need now so I haven't isntalled any other web-browser but if you need it r want to explore other options to browse the web... just go for it.

>**Image manipulation**

I have used [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) for years and I must say that it went from really complicated to a more friendly tool in the last few years, the UI has evolved and now it's really easy to navigate the menus and find the option you need.

I know there are other products, specially Adobe, that are use by professionals and people with high graphic skills but that's not my case, I am a simple usr that need to do some image manipulation, for example for this article. In my case the power of Gimp is way beyond my necesities, as with Libre Office I am only using the 1% of the tool.

![Gimp]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/gimp.png)

I have used [Inkscape](https://inkscape.org/) too for some vector image manipulation and the results were great, it is not too complicated to use and Internet is full of documentation.

>**Coding**

Here we are, big topic for Linux, probably developers were the first Linux users, people with "high" computer knowledge that were not too bother about desktop icons and enjoyed the endless posibilities of Linux for coding.

In my case I have some basic tools I use for coding and writting my blog articles

* **[Visual Studio Code](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/)**

I know it is a Microsoft tool but I already mentioned that this is not to talk about how bad Microsoft is... I honestly think that the effort Microsfot put releasing this UI for developer is really good. I've been using it for my Python and Java projects and I haven't find any issues with it; it is currently my main dev UI and it will probably be for a long time. If you are not using you should give it a try.

Getting it installed is really simple, visit the page and download the package for your distro.

![VSCode]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/vscode.png)

* **[Atom](https://atom.io/)**

Atom is super light and I used it for a long time, I still use it when I do need to open a individual file to inspect something lie a HTML file or an XML file; I like the simplicity of the UI and it was my main UI untill I moved to Visual Studio.

I have nothing to say against it and I think it is a great option, I know lots of people that love it.

If you want to use it in your Linux distro just visit the page and get the right package for your distro, you won't regret the decision.

![Atom]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/atom.png)

Visual Studio Code and Atom are just two examples of UIs that you have available in Linux, the list is endless and I'm sure some options are really good, just explore the options, play with them and decide which one is the one that you like; there are no excused in Linux not to start coding.

>**Other Tools**

Alongside those tools I already mentioned I have other softwre installed in my computer for different stuff that I do during the day. Some examples will be

* **[Slack](https://slack.com)**

I use slack mainly to comunicate with some friends, it is a easy to use tool that allow us to chat and share documentation without any complications; you can create channels which helps you organize different topics and coordinate different tasks at the same time. If you are not using it you should give it a try.

* **[Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-GB/)**

I've been using Thunderbird as my email client for many years, it is simple to configure and really easy to use, the interface is clear and you have all the options you need to work with emails.

Configurig accounts and signatures can be done with no effort and the integration with [GPG](https://gnupg.org/) helps you add some level of security to your emails if you need it.

![Thunderbird]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/thunderbird.png)


* **[FileZilla](https://filezilla-project.org/)**

Working with FTP couldn'tbe easier, FileZilla has been in my computer for a log time, it's another simple tool that does the job. If you need to use FTP and want to avoid the terminal then this is a great option for you.

![FileZilla]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/filezilla.png)

* **Ubuntu Software Centre**

My last mention will be for the Ubuntu Software Centre, some might hate it and some might love it don't have a strong opinion, I think it is a great tool with hundreds of options for any task you might need to perform in your Linux computer, I don't use it too much to be honest but I have used it and I have no issues with it.

What it is clear is that it has created a visual way to explore Linux applications that can be of great help.

## Is Linux for everyone then?

My initial question was; it is Linux an option for any user? and I will say that my answer is yes, I haven't find any task I can't do or any activity that require a high knowledge to be done; Linux distros are currently as friendly as any other operating system and the hardware compatibility is really good.

Give it a try and join the freedom of Linux, I'm sure you will love it.

Have a great day !!!
