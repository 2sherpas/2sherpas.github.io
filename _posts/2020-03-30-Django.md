As I mentioned in my previous article about [Jupyter Notebook](https://2sherpas.github.io/Jupyter-Notebook), I've been learning Python for the last couple of weeks and one thing that captured my interest was [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and his backend frameworks for building web pages.

Once again this article won't be a "use Django it is the best" or "don't use it is really bad" it is a simple explanation of my short experience with it and why I found it easy to use and useful for some of my future Python projects.

**Let's start !!**

First thing I will do is create a Python Virtual environment, this is a secure and easy way of running different Python projects in our computer

Go to the locatio that you want to use for it and run this command

> virtualenv sherpaenv

If you get an error you might need to install the package first, so just run this in your terminal

> pip install virtualenv

Now that we have our virtual environment created we need to start it before we can do anything with it, so let's start the enviornment

> source sherpaenv/bin/activate

Now your terminal wll looks like this, with the virtual environment information

![Sherpa Virtual Env]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/virtualEnv.png)


In the same terminal that we have started our Python virtual environment we can now install Django, just run this command

> pip3 install django

As simple as that and we have installed Django in our computer and is safely running on a Python virtual environment, so... what's next? To be honest is not log before we have our first Dango page, couple of steps more, back to the terminal

We need to create a project, in this example we will call the project Djangosherpa

> django-admin startproject Djangosherpas

Once you run that command it will create a "Djangosherpas" folder with some folders and files inside, that's our first project !!! 

Before we run our next command we need to navigate inside the project folder in our terminal, so 

> cd Djangosherpas

And now we are ready to start our Django server, come on!! 

> python3 manage.py runserver

You will see that when you run your server for the first tiem you get some errors in your terminal, but no worries about them for now, we will talk about fixing them later.

![Django Start Server]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/djangoStart.png)


**Now is the time to see if we have our first Django Page up and running**

Open your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:8000/

![Django Default Page]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/djangoDefault.png)


Congratulations, you have your first Django server up and running, your first project created and now you can access it and just in under 15 minutes, not bad.

Now it's time to do a couple of things, first let's fix the errors we got in the terminal and next let's create our first page, something more personal and not just the default Django server page.

So, let's fix the errors. First we need to stop the server, so type Ctrl C in the terminal and then

> python3 manage.py migrate

It couldn't be any easier, indeed Django was asking us to do it as part of the error we got.

Now if we start the server again it shouldn't complain about anything

> python3 manage.py runserver

**It's time to open our development UI**

For this example I will use Atom, not for something in particular, you can use any UI that you like. So open the IU and go to our project folder and it will looks like this

![Django Structure]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/djangoStructure.png)

Now we will open the file "urls.py" and start doing some basic changes for our first page; as a note I will say that the urls.py file is really important and it will help you manage the traffic for your whole site.

{% highlight python linenos %}
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    ]
{% endhighlight %}

We will add a line here to redirect some requests to our home.html page, but first we will create a new file in our project to make sure we have everything properly organised, we wil call that file "views.py".

In our views.py file we will add this code which is basically defining a function in python that will return a text as part of the http request. 

{% highlight python linenos %}
    from django.http import HttpResponse

    def homepage(request):
        return HttpResponse('Hello 2Sherpas')
{% endhighlight %}


Back to our urls.py and we will add two new lines. We need to import our recently ceated views to be able to use it and then add a line with a new path that means that our http://localhost:8000 url now is pointing to our new function we have created in our views.py file

{% highlight python linenos %}
    from django.contrib import admin
    from django.urls import path
    from . import views

    urlpatterns = [
        path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
        path('', views.homepage),
    ]
{% endhighlight %}

Let's save all the changes and se what happens when we go to http://localhost:8000 in our browser

![Django Text]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/djangoText.png)

**Amazing!!** we have now the capacity to show our own content in Django, well is not a super fancy content yet but... it is content.

Let's try to do one last thing and make our content a bit nicer, not super nice, but at least decent...

To do that we will need to create a new folder call "templates" and a new file call "home.html" and we need to reference that new folder in our django settings.py file, in the TEMPLATES section you need to add 'templates' at the DIRS line

![Templates]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/templates.png)

Back to our views.py file for some small changes; we need two import render from Django because this time we want to return a http render page not a text and we will change our function to return a .html page and not a text, here is the code

{% highlight python linenos %}
    from django.http import HttpResponse
    from django.shortcuts import render

    def homepage(request):
        #return HttpResponse('Hello 2Sherpas')
        return render(request,'home.html')
{% endhighlight %}


Before we can test our new homepage we will need to add some code to our home.html file

{% highlight html %}
    <H1>Hello 2Sherpas</H1>
    <H2>New home page up and running</H2>
{% endhighlight %}


**One more test** let's see what happens when we visit our homepage now

![New HomePage]({{site.url}}/{{site.baseurl}}img/post-assets/newHome.png)


**Awseome!!!** we have our own html page in Django, I know it's not amazing and it is static and.... but my intention was not to run a Django course just to show you how in some easy steps you can have your own page running in Django.

Of course Django is much more powerfull and you can do more things, connect to databases, run blogs... but that is for another day.

See you in the next article.

Thanks for reading it.
