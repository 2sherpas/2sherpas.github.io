</p><p>As a Technical Expert at Santander Technology I was leading the Authentication team responsable for designing and implementing CORE services for authentication. Those services are now consumed by the Online Banking Retail site and the Retail Mobile application.</p>

<p>As part of my time as a Team Leader I helped the team not just to delivered code but to spread knowledge and our passion for technology, we did run some 30 minutes talks about technology and Cyber security Challenges for our colleagues, our main intention with those initiatives were to share our love for technology and help others to learn.</p>

<p>At the same time I was working as a mentor for two colleagues in different teams, it was a really positive experience that I enjoyed a lot and provided me a platform to help people with their career aspirations.</p>

<p>Previous to my role as a leader for the Authentication Team I was leading teams working in legacy products as well as leading the business analist team. It was a really intense experfiencve that gave me expousure to a wide range of issues and challenges, from production issues to code improvements and team coordination necesities. During that time I tried to learn how to helps different roles with different expectations achieve a common goal.</p>

  <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-8 col-md-9 col-print-12"><p class="quote">Scrum is an agile way to manage a project, usually software development. Agile software development with Scrum is often perceived as a methodology; but rather than viewing Scrum as methodology, think of it as a framework for managing a process.
</p><p>As soon as Santander decided to implement agile as the main way of delivering Software I decided that it was the time for me to get the Scrum Master certification; I was no planning to act as a Scrum Master but wanted to fully understand the methodology so I can make sure the team fully adapted to it and benefit from it.</p>
