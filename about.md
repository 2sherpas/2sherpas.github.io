## 2 Sherpas - Who are we?

We are two IT professionals that wanted to find a space where we could explore our ideas, find new motivations, share the experiences and celebrate failure and success with the same energy.

We’ve been working together for a few years and lead different projects but always had the feeling that we could do more, we should do more and even more important we wanted to do more.

2Sherpas is the place where we will share our path to different summits by publishing a series of articles talking about coding, design, creating talent and more…

We don’t aim to be a reference or a place where you find the right way to do things. We aim to be a place where people can find themselves identified by our ideas and motivate them to create their own paths and find their own summits.

## Why are we Sherpas?

We come with the name in 2016 while working to set up a new team. Sherpas are those who help you carry the weigh during the journey, those who go with you to the summit but are not in the photo or get any recognition, they are vital for success but their aim is not glory but to help others achieve theirs. We thought it would be a great name for a team with intentions of creating talent, sharing knowledge and motivate people to learn new things..

After that experience finished we decided to carry on the name with us to this new experience as we end feeling strongly related to the name.
