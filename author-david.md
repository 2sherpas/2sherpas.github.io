# David Antona

I've been interested in IT for a really long time, since the first computer arrived to my house and I learned to code in Basic and the possibilities or interacting with the computer and creating my own programmes always fascinated me. Since that experience I started exploring other areas like creating my own computers by buying separate components and started playing with Linux in their early stages (before the UI was the default option).

I’m not just passionate about IT, I also love outdoors and I’ve been an outdoor person my whole live, from running to climbing, skiing, walking…. anything that take me out of the door will motivate me and make me feel happy.
